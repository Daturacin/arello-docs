#### Structure  
In appearance, reserin[^1] looks like, well, epoxy resin you might use for large craft projects. It takes on a teal or desaturated turquoise hue, and has a glossy iridescent look similar to [Labradorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labradorite). When held up to a bright light, it instead appears deep, translucent red. When touched it leaves behind a dusty residue that might stain the skin.  
Reserin is hard but extremely brittle and shatters and chips easily. Its hardness is a 6 on the [Mohs Hardness Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale) and is extremely similar to regular everyday glass. Due to its structure, abundance and beautiful appearance it is popular within jewelry making practices.
  
#### Properties  
Reserin crystals form at a rate that is completely unprecedented in comparison to other minerals, and typically forms above ground or close to the surface in large crystalline spikes or in thin, fragile sheets like ice. Why exactly it forms in this manner is speculated.Â 
These abilities associated with and gained from reserin have nothing to do with your typical idea of superpowers, which is why I call them abilities instead of powers. It's difficult to explain, but these abilities are best compared to elemental powers in the way they function for the user, working more magic minus the wands and other casting weapons.
