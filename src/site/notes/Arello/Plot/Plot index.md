### The Basis

The overarching plot of Arello starts with [[Arello/Worldbuilding/Reserin\|Reserin]], a fictional mineral named after its appearance, and also the substance responsible for the existence of supernatural abilities. The timeline this story follows begins in 2002 (i did NOT want to have to mention the twin towers falling or whatever but i wanted something early 2000s)
